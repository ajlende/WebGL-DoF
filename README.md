# Depth of Field

The depth of field effects used in this demo are based off of BokehPass.js and BokehShader.js from the three.js website which is in turn based off of a GLSL shader from [a blog post](http://artmartinsh.blogspot.com/2010/02/glsl-lens-blur-filter-with-bokeh.html) by Martins Upitis.

Additionally, my shader gives the option to choose from a number of additional bokeh shapes including a triangle, pentagon, and star.

This shader approximates the depth of field and bokeh in a simple manner. Martin Upitis has also created a more sophisticated bokeh shader which is described in [this blog post](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?237488-GLSL-depth-of-field-with-bokeh-v2-4-%28update%29) and can be seen in action [here](http://www.andrewberg.com/prototypes/threejs/bokeh/).

I did a presentation on depth of field and this project for a computer graphics class I took that can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12mEfENuWb60KJ7_SRu71z8DT9RLrGYyYSbW1_eQpqSM/edit?usp=sharing).
